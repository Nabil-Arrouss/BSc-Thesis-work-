# Predicting Partial Charges in Organic Molecules Using Machine Learning

## üìò Overview

This repository contains the implementation and supporting materials for my thesis project, **"Predicting Partial Charges in Organic Molecules Using Machine Learning."**

The goal of this work is to develop a neural network model capable of accurately estimating **partial atomic charges** in organic molecules based solely on **molecular geometries**.  
By providing an open and reproducible approach, this project aims to overcome the limitations of traditional, often proprietary, computational chemistry tools.

## üß† Background

Partial charges are a fundamental concept in organic chemistry, influencing molecular interactions, reactivity, and physical properties.  
Traditional methods for charge estimation, while accurate, often rely on **software-specific algorithms** or **quantum chemical calculations**, limiting accessibility and scalability.

This project explores a **data-driven**, AI‚Äìbased approach to estimate partial charges efficiently while maintaining high accuracy.
